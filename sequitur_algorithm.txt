1. make the CONTEXT the last character of the SEQUENCE
2. use the CONTEXT to TRAVERSE into the SUFFIX-TRIE
3. increase the CONTEXT until there are a minimum of endpoints (more than 1)
4. if there is one option, add it to the SEQUENCE and start again until every READ has been seen
5. if there is more than one option, shelf that SEQUENCE and start a new SEQUENCE elsewhere until an option is eliminated
